When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

 - I would use the remote repository when I want to be able to access the files from another computer.
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

 - Changes done to the remote repository may be done by others as well. Maybe you dont want to pull that code just yet into your local repository when its not entirely completed. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 - Fork is a clone of a repository that is made directly on github, rather than on your local computer.
  - Clones are copies of repositories that are pulled from a remote location onto your own computer or device.
  - branches are new separate chains of commits that are created away from the master branch. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 - In case where you screw up the changes you want to make and dont catch them before you pull the remote file in, you can go back to a prior commit [like I did :)]
