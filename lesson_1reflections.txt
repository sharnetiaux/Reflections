How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

- It took hundreds of lines of code from two different files and compared them to each other, pointing out which
lines differed between them. This made it easy to spot the typo in the problem, rather than going through each line of
the code manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

- Having access to these previous files make comparing old vs new files much easier. It also keeps these older versions of 
files more organized and easy to access through version control rather than saving these files under different names manually.
When working in a group setting, I could see how having version control would be very usefull, especially when other team members
are trying to access older versions of files. It's all right there for everyone to access, rather than having to send a zip to someone else
manually.
